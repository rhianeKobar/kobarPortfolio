			<p>
				Hey! I'm a Front-end developer and UI Designer. Recently I completed the Maker's Academy 
				coding bootcamp. Now I'm super excited to work on/contribute to new/existing projects 
				that help me strengthen and expand my skillset and meet incredible techies.
			</p>
			<p>
				Put me to work on anything (ethical).  
				I'm especially interested in the areas of open source, sustainability, accessibility, AI, 
				communication, data analysis, gaming, security, mobile, transport and education. I love 
				collaboration, everyone brings something of value to the table and it's great to have 
				other people to bounce ideas off of. I'm also comfortable working alone or isolated. I'd 
				be really excited to work with a remote team using tech for good that recognises the 
				importance of diversity and inclusion especially in tech.
			</p>
			<p>
				Outside of coding, I play bass, love fermentation and gardening, DIY and gaming 
				(add me on switch).
			</p>
