			<h3>About me</h3>
			<p>
				Queer communist excited about building products that enhance people's lives, spaces and businesses while
				showcasing and developing my skills. I've been designing and building websites and web apps for over a year now with a mixture of 
				Figma, Ruby on Rails, React, SCSS, Bootstrap and Wordpress. I've gotten especially good at translating a Figma file to a piece of code.
				Other than the technologies I use, I'm pretty easy going and I like to make sure we both understand the scope of work and what's 
				expected before we start work to put our best foot forward. Outside of coding, I'm big on self care, gardening, getting out into 
				nature and gaming.
			</p>

			<h3>Work Opportunities</h3>	
			<p> 
				I'm currently looking for freelance/contract work. Ideally, I 
				like to work solo as it's more time flexible but working collaboratively hasn't been 
				a problem in the past and it provides the opportunity to learn and teach. I'd 
				be really excited to work with a remotely using tech for good and if I'm part of a team, one  
				that recognises the importance of diversity and inclusion especially in tech.
